# Active Directory Powershell GUI

I developed this gui to make searching across multiple domains easier.  The ability to save queries and enter raw powershell commands makes this a powerful tool in any administrators toolset.

Requires the Microsoft Remote Server Administration tools installed for the active directory powershell commands. Optionally you can install the ImportExcel module to allow exporting directly to excel.
